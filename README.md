# CALCULATOR IN .C

This project is based on the natural evolution of using software engineering and programming knowledge, using a calculator built in .c as an example.

1. Version 0 requires specifying which operation to perform as an option.

2. Version 1 focuses on performing the operation without specifying which operand to use. It includes the basic operands of addition and subtraction.

3. Version 2 will add more operators without specifying them and will include negative signs.

4. Version 3 will add state machines that recognize and parse different patterns.

5. Version 4 will allow for algebraic calculations, which will enable changing the order of processing and the priority of operations using stacks.
